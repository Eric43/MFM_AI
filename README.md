# MFM_AI
Repository for image classification AI on Ob/Gyn ultrasounds.
## Overview
The goal of this repository is to act as a collection of notebooks, code, data sets and inference images used for the development of image classification models on fetal ultrasound images.  The strucutre may change in the future as number and type of models increases.  The initial purpose of this repository is to put the methods and data used for publication into the public sphere.
## Structure
The notebooks folder contains basic notebooks used to train the different models.  Next, the code folder is where code either used in the notebooks or independantly may be added and used as stand alone functions.  Finally, the data sets folder will contain the two data sets used for publication and the different inference images.
